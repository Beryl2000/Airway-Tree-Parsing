# Airway Tree Parsing

This repository contains code for airway tree parsing using two algorithms: **Ours** and **Wingsnet**. The goal of the project is to parse the segmented tree into a meaningful representation for further analysis.


## Requirements

- Python 3.11.10
- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `pyvista`
- `skimage`
- `SimpleITK`
- `cc3d`

You can install the necessary packages via pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
